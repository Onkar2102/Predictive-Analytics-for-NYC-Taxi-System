![Daily Earnings Dashboard](dashboard/screenshots/page3-daily-revenue.png)

**Purpose**
Lets analysts zoom from monthly roll-ups down to day-level behaviour, revealing intra-month peaks, forecasted trends, and any special-condition spikes.

| Element | What it shows | Why it matters |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **Year & Month slicers** (button ribbons) | Quick selectors for **2019 ‚Äì 2021** and the twelve months (e.g., *2020 ¬∑ July* active). | Enables side-by-side comparison of any month/year combo without leaving the page‚Äîcrucial for spotting pandemic-era anomalies or seasonal surges. |
| **Total Earning by Day** (line with forecast band) | Daily average fare for the chosen month; last few days are grey-shaded with a dashed projection (Power BI forecast). | Exposes weekday vs weekend patterns, sudden spikes (e.g., holiday events), and gives an early look at expected revenue for the rest of the month. |
| **Top 3 Zones** (ranked card list) | Highest-earning taxi zones within the selected month‚Äîe.g., **Lenox Hill East $3.75 K**, **Upper East Side North $4.60 K**. | Highlights where short-term marketing (promo codes, fleet re-balancing) will yield the biggest immediate return. |
| **Number of Trips for Certain Condition** (two-row matrix) | Counts of rides flagged **N** (no) vs **Y** (yes) for:<br/>‚Ä¢ `snow_season` **0 / 0**<br/>‚Ä¢ `rush_hour_trip` **2 676 / 22**<br/>‚Ä¢ `mid_night_trip` **662 / 9**<br/>‚Ä¢ `isAirportTrip` **305 / 2** | Quantifies the operational burden of special scenarios for the month, letting dispatch plan staffing and price surges at the right times of day. |

**Key Insights (July 2020 example)**
- **Mid-month spike (~Day 5)** pushes daily earnings above **$21 K**, likely tied to holiday travel; forecast suggests a smaller but steady uptick after Day 30.
- **Rush-hour dominance** ‚Äì > 2.7 K rides occur in commuter windows, yet only 22 are marked with explicit ‚Äúrush-hour‚Äù surcharge flags, hinting at missed premium-fare opportunities.
- **Airport runs**‚Äîthough just 307 in total‚Äîremain lucrative on a per-ride basis; consider dedicated flat-rate or premium service marketing for LaGuardia/JFK during late July.

### Page 4: Time-of-Day & Day-of-Week Patterns
![Time-of-Day Earnings Dashboard](dashboard/screenshots/page4-day-of-week-earnings.png)

**Purpose**
Reveals when, during a typical week, each time-of-day slot is most lucrative and links those patterns to high-earning zones and special-condition workloads.

| Element | What it shows | Why it matters |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **Year & Month slicers** (button ribbons) | Quick filters for **2019 ‚Äì 2021** and all 12 months. | Lets analysts isolate any calendar slice‚Äîcrucial for comparing pre-/post-pandemic or peak-season behaviours. |
| **Average Total Earning per Day of Week** (multi-line chart) | Average fare on each weekday (**0 = Sun ‚Ä¶ 6 = Sat**) split by **Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Late-night**. | Highlights revenue-rich periods: late-night rides top the chart all week, while mornings trail until a Saturday uptick‚Äîguiding driver rostering and surge-pricing windows. |
| **Top 3 Zones** (ranked card list) | Highest-earning zones for the current filter‚Äîe.g., **Upper East Side North $134.9 K**, **Midtown Center $102.9 K** (third zone scrollable). | Pin-points neighbourhoods to target with time-based promos (e.g., weekend late-night incentives in Midtown). |
| **Number of Trips for Certain Conditions** (two-row matrix) | Counts **N vs Y** for:<br/>‚Ä¢ `snow_season` **33 167 / 424**<br/>‚Ä¢ `rush_hour_trip` **69 236 / 739**<br/>‚Ä¢ `mid_night_trip` **23 943 / 241**<br/>‚Ä¢ `isAirportTrip` **11 145 / 144** | Quantifies operational load tied to special scenarios during the selected slice‚Äîkey for staffing and policy tweaks (e.g., winter night shifts). |

**Key Take-aways**
- **Late-night dominates**: averages hover above **$21** every night, peaking on Sundays‚Äîclear evidence to keep more cabs on the road after midnight.
- **Weekend uplift**: **Morning** and **Afternoon** earnings jump on Saturdays (Day 6), hinting at tourist or leisure traffic.
- **Rush-hour intensity**: ~**70 K** weekday trips fall into commuter windows, yet only ~**1 %** carry the explicit rush-hour flag‚Äîan opportunity to refine surcharge rules.
- **Zone targeting**: Consistently high takings in Upper East Side North and Midtown suggest concentrating EV-charging hubs or promo codes there for late-night riders.

### Page 5: Descriptive Trip Trends
![Multi-Metric Trip Trends](dashboard/screenshots/page5-descriptive-analysis.png)

**Purpose**
Puts the five core ride-level metrics on a single time-series to visualise the pandemic dip, the recovery arc and long-term behaviour of NYC taxi demand.

| Element | What it shows | Why it matters |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **Multi-metric line chart ‚Äì Descriptive Analysis of Trip** | Five lines tracked month-by-month (left axis for `tip_amount`, `total_amount`, `passenger_count`, `trip_distance`; right axis for `trip_duration`). | Lets decision-makers see how Covid (April 2020 collapse) slashed demand & spending, how quickly each metric rebounded, and whether ride length/duration patterns changed in tandem. |

**Key Insights**
- **Covid shock & rebound** ‚Äì All metrics plunge in April 2020; revenue and distance start climbing again by June, while trip duration rises more slowly, reflecting shorter local rides during early reopening.
- **Passenger count stability** ‚Äì The purple `passenger_count` line stays relatively flat, hinting that single-rider trips remained the norm both pre- and post-pandemic.
- **Duration vs distance divergence** ‚Äì From late 2020 onward, `trip_distance` edges up but `trip_duration` jumps sharply, suggesting heavier traffic or more waiting time despite similar mileage‚Äîuseful for fare model tweaks or driver pay adjustments.
- **Tip resilience** ‚Äì The blue `tip_amount` line mirrors `total_amount`, showing riders continued tipping in proportion to fares even during downturns‚Äîreassuring for driver earnings.

### Page 6: Key Influencers ‚Äì Tip Drivers
![Key Influencers (Tip Amount)](dashboard/screenshots/page6-key-influencers.png)

**Purpose**
Uses Power BI‚Äôs AI-driven *Key Influencers* visual to reveal which trip attributes most strongly drive higher **`tip_amount`** (and, by extension, total revenue). This equips managers with evidence-based levers for service improvements and targeted promotions.

| Element | What it shows | Why it matters |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **Key Influencers list** (left pane) | Automatically ranks the variables that cause `tip_amount` to increase. Example impacts:<br/>‚Ä¢ `tolls_amount` > **$2.80** ‚Üí average tip **+ $4.64**<br/>‚Ä¢ **Drop-off zone = LaGuardia Airport** ‚Üí **+ $4.38**<br/>‚Ä¢ `isAirportTrip = 1` ‚Üí **+ $3.74**<br/>‚Ä¢ **Pick-up zone = JFK Airport** ‚Üí **+ $3.70**<br/>‚Ä¢ `trip_distance` > **3 mi** ‚Üí **+ $1.96** | Pinpoints the strongest levers for boosting gratuities‚Äîe.g., airport rides with tolls yield far better tips, suggesting where to focus premium service or upsell efforts. |
| **Influence comparison chart** (right pane) | For the selected driver (e.g., `tolls_amount > $2.80`), bar chart contrasts average tip when the condition is met vs. not met. | Gives a tangible, side-by-side uplift figure that makes the statistical impact immediately clear to non-technical stakeholders, strengthening the case for policy changes (e.g., clearer toll disclosure). |
| **‚ÄúTop segments‚Äù tab** | Clusters rides into homogeneous groups with the highest predicted tips. | Helps craft hyper-targeted promotions‚Äîe.g., late-night JFK pickups carrying 2‚Äì3 passengers who routinely tip above average. |

**Key Take-aways**
- **Tolls are the single biggest driver**‚Äîcustomers who pay > **$2.80** in tolls tip roughly **2.4√ó** the overall average (**$6.4 vs $1.9**).
- **Airport traffic matters**‚Äîboth pick-ups and drop-offs at JFK or LaGuardia significantly boost tips, reinforcing the value of prioritising these routes.
- **Longer trips, bigger tips**‚Äîdistances above **3 miles** correlate with a **$2** uplift, supporting mileage-based incentive structures for drivers.
- **Borough nuance**‚ÄîQueens pick-ups outperform Brooklyn drop-offs, hinting at local rider tipping culture differences worth exploring.
